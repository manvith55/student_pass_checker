# student_pass_checker
Project Overview
"Student Pass Checker" is a frontend web application that verifies student eligibility for free bus tickets based on three conditions. If the user meets all the requirements, they are prompted to confirm their booking.

Tech Stack

Features
✅ Simple and user-friendly UI

How It Works
The user checks the relevant conditions (student status, age, and ID).
Clicking "Check" evaluates the conditions.
If all conditions are met, a confirmation prompt appears.
Clicking "OK" displays a success message; otherwise, the user is notified they won’t receive a ticket.
